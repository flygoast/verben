verben
======================================================================

`verben' is a TCP server framework you can customize your logical 
business code. `verben' is responsible for networking processing. 
You need not to care it.

`verben' comes from the middle partion of `server bench', which is the
predecessor of `verben'.

In `plugins' directories, there are some plugin demos. You can refer
them to write your business code.

At present, there a core dump bug when execute 'verben stop' sometimes.
Maybe someday, I'll fix it......
